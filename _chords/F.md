## About This Chord

F Major is warm and resolute, often lending a sense of strength and stability to kanklÄ—s harmonies. Its rich sonority makes it ideal for grounding modal passages, especially in sutartinÄ—s that explore brighter emotional textures. The chordâ€™s slightly lower tonal center compared to C major gives it a mellow, earthy character.
