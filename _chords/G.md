## About This Chord

G Major is bold and expansive, often used to lift kanklÄ—s melodies into brighter, more expressive territory. Its resonant quality makes it a favorite for sutartinÄ—s that emphasize open intervals and harmonic movement. As a dominant chord in the key of C, it naturally leads the listener toward resolution, adding dynamic tension to modal transitions.
