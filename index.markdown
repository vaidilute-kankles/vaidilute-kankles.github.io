- List of all the chords (ideally with finger diagrams)
- List of our songs... the 9-string ones, and try to get the sheet music large kankles songs, too
- Try and get the scanned music from the old big folder in, and also the music notes from the little books
- Maybe see if we can show the chords on the 9 string songs so it's easy to reference
- download the sheet music
- videos for songs, maybe even for chords
- exercises (along with videos)
- maybe a Techniques, Excercises and Tips section (maybe need a one-word title for that... 'Skills'? Or maybe just 'Technique')
- links to our favourite versions of songs by others
- links to other kankles things (groups, people, etc)
- performances, maybe? Or links to events (maybe from facebook)
- link to facebook page, photos?
- set lists we've had, maybe categories for songs (christmas, church, stately, dance, etc)
- what's good for this homepage? random photo banner, and then what? latest songs? Some welcome text? Not sure
